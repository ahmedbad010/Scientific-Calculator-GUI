# Scientific-Calculator-GUI

<h4>
This is my first project i do in my collage , its about a scientific calculator and it is a gui app from Apache NetBeans IDE 16 app there is many code lines 
because i use jframe from the ide so i design the buttons  and the ide write the code that i design and i write 316 lines of code about the calculator, 
so in the future i will write tis app again and not in jframe from apache netbeans IDE  and i will write this app in many  languages.
